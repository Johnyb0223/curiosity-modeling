# Project Objective: 
	
Conway's Game of Life is a classic cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The game operates based on a set of rules that determine the state of each cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its neighboring cells.

In the game, cells evolve through generations according to the following rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The goal of modeling Conway's Game of Life with Forge is to simulate the evolution of the grid of cells according to these rules.

# Model Design and Visualization: 
	
#### TODO 
Give an overview of your model design choices, what checks or run statements you wrote, and what we should expect to see 
from an instance produced by the Sterling visualizer. 
How should we look at and interpret an instance created by your spec? Did you create a custom visualization, or did you use the default?
# Signatures and Predicates: 

#### TODO
At a high level, what do each of your sigs and preds represent in the context of the model? 
Justify the purpose for their existence and how they fit together.

# Testing:

#### TODO
What tests did you write to test your model itself? What tests did you write to verify properties about your domain area? 
Feel free to give a high-level overview of this.

# Documentation:

#### TODO
Make sure your model and test files are well-documented. This will help in understanding the structure and logic of your project.
